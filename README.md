Public Safety & Infrastructure Risk Modeling (CoreTech Labs / 10Alytics)

# Project Overview

This project develops an industry-grade public safety analytics dashboard built under CoreTech Labs (10Alytics, United Kingdom) to analyze road traffic accident data and support public safety governance, infrastructure planning, and transportation risk policy modeling.

The system transforms large-scale accident records into interactive decision dashboards that reveal casualty severity patterns, infrastructure risk hotspots, vehicle-type vulnerabilities, and environmental risk factors — supporting data-driven safety interventions and infrastructure investment prioritization.

# Objectives

• Analyze fatal, serious, and slight casualties across road networks
• Identify high-risk road types, locations, and light conditions
• Support infrastructure investment prioritization
• Enable urban vs rural safety comparisons
• Provide policy-ready dashboards for decision makers

# Methodology

Industry Program: CoreTech Labs – 10Alytics (UK)

Analytics Tools:
Python, Pandas, SQL, Power BI

Visual Components:
Interactive dashboards, trend analysis, segmentation filters, geospatial insights

# Dashboard Components
Component	Policy Value
Casualty severity classification	Public safety risk profiling
Monthly casualty trends	Seasonal risk forecasting
Road type casualties	Infrastructure prioritization
Road surface conditions	Environmental risk modeling
Light condition casualties	Visibility-based safety planning
Vehicle-type risk	Mode-specific safety policy
Urban vs rural split	Regional infrastructure allocation
# Key Insights

• Over 417,000 casualty records analyzed
• Single carriageways show highest casualty concentration
• Rural roads exhibit elevated fatality risk
• Wet and icy road surfaces significantly increase accident severity
• Night-time accidents carry higher fatality risk

# Applications

• Transportation safety governance
• Infrastructure investment planning
• Public safety risk modeling
• Smart mobility policy analytics
• Government transportation research
